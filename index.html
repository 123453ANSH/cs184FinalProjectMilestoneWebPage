Summarize what you have accomplished:

So far in the project, we have created a vibrating sheet that emulates the vibrating plate in the Chladni Plate. The process of doing this involved playing with the cloth of homework 4 to design a fabric that had the right properties to mimic the Chladni Plate so when a vibration was applied to its center, the fabric moved in a way that mimicked the Chladni Plate. Following this, more work was done to further improve the simulation of the fabric to mimic the Chladni Plate. Specifically, for both the initial creation of the mimicking fabric and further improvement, the ks, density, and damping parameters were modified. Following this, we worked on simulating the balls that would perturb to represent the sand in the Chladni Plate Simulation. 

Following the attempt of getting the ball to bounce on the simulated cloth and making it simulate the sand, our team realized the complexity associated with the solutions we wanted to devise were a bit too high, and therefore wanted to switch to another idea we thought was likely the best idea. We chose to pursue several ideas and see how they would turn out, but we had our sights on getting one of them to work and moving forward with it. 

The idea we wanted to pursue is essentially using the vibrating cloth I described above used as an unseen cloth that particles we simulate bounce off of using the normals that are generated when the particle hits the cloth as the direction the particles go toward. The particles are displayed in the simulation, and in place of the vibrating cloth, what is actually displayed is a flat rectangle that the particles seem to be bouncing off of. We have implemented this, and if we are able to generate a simulation fast enough with the flat rectangle vibrating at a frequency represented by how the balls are bouncing, we aim to do this as a final step.

Preliminary results:

The first preliminary result we have is a picture of the cloth simulating in a perturbing fashion. Here is an image of the simulation:

The second is the simulation of the path we are taking moving forward: the particles bouncing off an unseen vibrating cloth, and a flat rectangle in the vibrating clothâ€™s place. Furthermore, this simulation is without the flat rectangle vibrating at the frequency of balls bouncing off the unseen cloth. Here is a picture of the simulation: 

Progress relative to my plan:
