    <h2>Summary of Accomplishments</h2>
    <p>So far in the project, we have created a vibrating sheet that emulates the vibrating plate in the Chladni Plate. We modified parameters like ks, density, and damping to refine the simulation. Later, we simulated perturbing balls representing the sand in the Chladni Plate Simulation.</p>
    <p>Following the attempt to simulate the sand, we realized the complexity of our solutions was too high. Thus, we decided to pursue another idea. Our focus shifted to using the vibrating cloth as an unseen surface for particles to bounce off. We implemented this idea, where particles bounce off a flat rectangle representing the cloth.</p>

    <h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
    <p>The first preliminary result is an image of the cloth simulating in a perturbing fashion.</p>

    <p>The second result is the simulation of particles bouncing off an unseen vibrating cloth, with a flat rectangle replacing the cloth. This simulation does not include the rectangle vibrating at the frequency of the bouncing balls.</p>

    <h2>Progress Update</h2>
    <p>According to our project plan, we are right on schedule.</p>

    <h2>Updated Work Plan</h2>
    <p>No updates are needed for the work plan at this time.</p>
